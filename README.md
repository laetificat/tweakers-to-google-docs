# Tweakers to Google Docs
This extension will add a new context (right-click) menu option when you are on a tweakers pricewatch product page, for example: https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1047643/intel-core-i7-8700k-boxed.html

The extension will scrape the DOM for the name, price and url and copies it to your clipboard. The copied text will be seperated by tabs which Google Docs uses to decide the column. 

Currently the order of data is name, amount (defaults to 1), price (cheapest), (empty column), url. 
Example: `Intel Core i7-8700K Boxed\t1\t405,35\t\thttps://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1047643/intel-core-i7-8700k-boxed.html`
